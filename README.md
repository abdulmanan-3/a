Slide 2 – Introduction
Livestock manure → significant source of GHGs (CH₄, N₂O, CO₂)

Different management systems → varied emissions

Understanding emission factors is essential for climate mitigation

Speaker note:
“Manure management greatly affects how much methane and nitrous oxide are emitted. This review systematically compares GHG emission factors across various systems.”

Slide 3 – Research Question
Main Research Question:
What are the comparative greenhouse gas emission factors associated with different manure management systems?

Slide 4 – Research String
Example search string:

Copy
Edit
(“manure management” OR “animal waste treatment” OR “livestock manure”) AND 
(“greenhouse gas” OR “GHG” OR “methane” OR “nitrous oxide” OR “carbon dioxide”) AND 
(“emission factor” OR “emissions” OR “mitigation”)
Adapted slightly for each database syntax

Speaker note:
“The search string was carefully constructed to capture all studies measuring GHG emissions linked to different manure management systems.”

Slide 5 – Databases Searched
Databases used:

Web of Science

Scopus

PubMed

Google Scholar

Time period: 2010–2024

Language: English

Speaker note:
“I selected databases covering environmental sciences, agriculture, and engineering to ensure comprehensive coverage.”

Speaker note:
“The PRISMA diagram illustrates the systematic process for selecting relevant studies.”

Slide 8 – Quality Assessment
Criteria used:

Methodological rigor (e.g. direct measurements vs. modeling)

Sample size

Regional applicability

Clarity of reporting units (kg CH₄/t manure, etc.)

Scoring system: e.g. Low, Medium, High

Speaker note:
“We assessed study quality to ensure we relied on robust emission data.”

Slide 9 – Bibliometric Analysis
Total publications: 45

Growth of publications over time (include a graph if possible)

Top journals publishing this research:

Journal of Cleaner Production

Science of the Total Environment

Waste Management

Top contributing countries:

China

USA

Germany

Netherlands

Speaker note:
“The field has grown, with most research clustered in a few high-impact journals and regions.”

Slide 10 – Network Analysis
Co-authorship networks:

Key research groups collaborating internationally

Keyword co-occurrence network:

Common themes:

Methane emissions

Anaerobic digestion

Composting

Emission factors

Visuals:

Include network maps from software like VOSviewer or Biblioshiny

Speaker note:
“Network analysis reveals strong research clusters around topics like anaerobic digestion and composting.”

Slide 11 – Content Analysis
GHG emission factors by system (example values):

System	CH₄ (kg/t)	N₂O (kg/t)	CO₂ (kg/t)
Liquid storage	3.5–12.0	0.02–0.08	Variable
Solid storage	0.5–2.0	0.10–0.45	Variable
Composting	0.2–1.5	0.15–0.65	High CO₂
Anaerobic digestion	0.1–0.6	0.01–0.05	Lower net CO₂

Findings:

Liquid storage → highest methane

Anaerobic digestion → lowest methane

Composting → moderate emissions but potential for higher N₂O

Speaker note:
“This summary shows that anaerobic digestion consistently has the lowest methane emissions, while liquid storage is a major hotspot.”

Slide 12 – Challenges Identified
Large variability in reported emission factors

Differences in:

Climate conditions

Measurement techniques

Manure types

Limited data from:

Tropical regions

Small-scale farms

Inconsistent reporting units

Slide 13 – Conclusion
Manure management systems show significant differences in GHG emission factors

Anaerobic digestion offers major reductions in methane emissions

Knowledge gaps persist, especially in:

Regional emission factors

Long-term field studies

Integrated assessments (GHGs, economics, environment)

Slide 14 – Recommendations
Encourage adoption of low-emission systems:

Anaerobic digestion

Covered storage

Develop region-specific emission factors

Promote standard reporting protocols

Support integrated studies combining emissions, costs, and environmental impacts

Enhance knowledge sharing and farmer training
